# GMSEGAME
__Gamesourcing GMSE stakeholder actions__

This is the main repository for the code for [Animal & Farm](https://ochil-ds.co.uk/animalnfarm/), an interactive game front end for [GMSE](https://github.com/ConFooBio/gmse).

Note that GMSEGAME/Animal&Farm is currently (Sep 2021) using a development version of GMSME, which is available in branch [`man_control`](https://github.com/ConFooBio/gmse/tree/man_control) in GMSE. 

The database for game play data storage is hosted externally; access to this is a prerequisite for running the code presented here. Testing (locally hosted) databases can be set up; if doing so, this needs to be accounted for in the database access scripts.
